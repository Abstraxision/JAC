                I think that one of the things about being aroace for me is the
                realization that I actually would like a partner, but it isn't a
                viable option. I want someone to cook for and cuddle and share
                life with, someone to be my person. But I don't experience
                attraction, so I cannot offer the bare minimum that anyone the
                slightest bit allo expects from a long-term relationship. And
                some days I feel like I can make peace with that, but some days
                it feels like the end of the world.
